         * The input[] buffer contains a string of phonemes and stress markers along
         * the lines of:
         *
         *     DHAX KAET IHZ AH5GLIY.
         *
         * Some phonemes are 2 bytes long, such as "DH" and "AX".
         * Others are 1 byte long, such as "T" and "Z".
         * There are also stress markers, such as "5" and ".".
         *
         * The characters of the phonemes are stored in the table PhonemeNameTable.
         * The stress characters are arranged in low to high stress order in StressTable[].
         *
         * The following process is used to parse the input buffer:
         *
         * Repeat until the end is reached:
         * 1. First, a search is made for a 2 character match for phonemes that do not
         *    end with the '*' (wildcard) character. On a match, the index of the phoneme
         *    is added to the result and the buffer position is advanced 2 bytes.
         *
         * 2. If this fails, a search is made for a 1 character match against all
         *    phoneme names ending with a '*' (wildcard). If this succeeds, the
         *    phoneme is added to result and the buffer position is advanced
         *    1 byte.
         *
         * 3. If this fails, search for a 1 character match in the stressInputTable[].
         *   If this succeeds, the stress value is placed in the last stress[] table
         *   at the same index of the last added phoneme, and the buffer position is
         *   advanced by 1 byte.
         *
         * If this fails, return false.
         *
         * On success:
         *
         *    1. phonemeIndex[] will contain the index of all the phonemes.
         *    2. The last index in phonemeIndex[] will be 255.
         *    3. stress[] will contain the stress value for each phoneme
         *
         * input holds the string of phonemes, each two bytes wide
         * signInputTable1[] holds the first character of each phoneme
         * signInputTable2[] holds the second character of each phoneme
         * phonemeIndex[] holds the indexes of the phonemes after parsing input[]
         *
         * The parser scans through the input[], finding the names of the phonemes
         * by searching signInputTable1[] and signInputTable2[]. On a match, it
         * copies the index of the phoneme into the phonemeIndexTable[].
